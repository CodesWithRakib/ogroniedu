# Changelog

## 1.2.0 — Phase 02 Architecture Foundation & Centralized State Management

- Added centralized state management and resilient API data fetching using **Redux Toolkit 2.x** and **RTK Query** in `apps/web/src/store/`.
- Configured RTK Query `baseApi` with automated correlation token injection (`x-request-id`), `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, and cache tag invalidation (`['Notification', 'UnreadCount', 'User', 'Session']`).
- Built modular slices for authentication (`authSlice`) and UI interactions (`uiSlice`) with typed hooks (`useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`).
- Created React 19 / Next.js App Router compatible `StoreProvider` utilizing `useRef` store singleton.
- Implemented backend structured JSON logging (`StructuredLoggerService`) with automated PII masking.
- Implemented `RequestIdMiddleware` for distributed request correlation and `AllExceptionsFilter` for canonical error payload contracts.
- Implemented container health and readiness probes (`/health/live`, `/health/ready`) via `@nestjs/terminus`.
- Added startup environment variable schema validation (`validateEnvironment`).
- Created GitHub Actions CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) enforcing frozen install, formatting, docs validation, typecheck, tests, and build.
- Recorded ADR-008 for Monorepo Tooling, Architecture Foundation, and Centralized State Management.
- Expanded automated test suite from 26 to 44 passing tests (33 backend + 11 frontend).

## 1.1.0 — Phase 0 Foundation & Phase 01 Repository and Environment Audit

- Established Turborepo monorepo with pnpm 12 workspaces (`apps/api`, `apps/web`, `packages/contracts`, `packages/tsconfig`).
- Configured root `.gitignore`, `.prettierrc`, and `.prettierignore` with automated code formatting.
- Built Centralized Real-time Notification Engine (`NotificationGateway`, `NotificationService`, `NotificationController`).
- Refactored backend DTOs to class-based models decorated with `class-validator` and `class-transformer` (`DispatchNotificationDto`, `GetNotificationsQueryDto`, `MarkAsReadParamDto`).
- Expanded automated test suite to 26 passing tests across unit, socket, DTO validation, cross-user isolation, and UI components.
- Completed comprehensive Phase 01 Repository and Environment Audit report (`docs/audits/repository-and-environment-audit.md`).
- Updated `VERSION-VERIFICATION.md` verifying runtime versions (Node.js v26.8.1, pnpm 12.10.1, PostgreSQL 18, Next.js 16.4.0, NestJS 12.1.2).
