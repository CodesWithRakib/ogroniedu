## Objective

Implement tutor profile, qualifications and review workflow.

## Required reading

- `README.md`
- `docs/04-product-requirements.md`
- `docs/05-user-roles-and-permissions.md`
- `docs/traceability-matrix.md`
- `docs/20-testing-strategy.md`
- `docs/checklists/definition-of-done.md`

## Scope

Support subjects/levels/curricula, modes, areas, price, availability basics, private evidence uploads, review/needs-info/approve/reject/suspend history and publication eligibility. Tutors cannot change own verification status.

## Expected artifacts

Tutor module, admin review flow, private file integration, audit events.

## Verification

Upload limits, self-approval denial, reviewer permissions, transition validation, public/private DTOs.

## Acceptance criteria

- Current phase scope only; no silent feature skipping or unrelated refactor.
- Server-side authorization and ownership tested for affected operations.
- Unit/integration/E2E and negative/failure-path tests added at appropriate levels.
- Bangla/English, accessibility and responsive behavior checked when UI changes.
- Migrations, API docs, test matrix and traceability updated.
- No existing tests disabled or weakened.
- Exact commands and actual outcomes included in the final report.
